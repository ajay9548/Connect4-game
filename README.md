Introduction
Connect Four, also known as Four in a Row, is a two-player connection game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent.
